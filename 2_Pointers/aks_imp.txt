
PROPERTY 1 
if segment from L to R satisfies the Good Property 
1. then any segment inside this should be good  (all inner GOOD)
OR 
2. big segment outside should also be Good  (all outer GOOD)

PROPERTY 2
Able to recalculate the function when you 
1. add a new element (from right when r++)
2. remove an element (from left when l--)

f0(r,0,num-1) {
    add(r);
    while(!good()) {
        remove(l);
        l++;
    }
}
